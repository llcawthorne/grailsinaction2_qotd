# grailsinaction2_qotd

simple quote of the day app from Grails in Action, 2nd edition

Remember; Grails in Action was written when Grails 2 was a thing.  Grails 3 is all different and based on Spring Boot, and it looks like Grails 4 will be all different still and based on micronaut.  While I do like the build in GORM search functions and having a command line tool that does a lot more than the simple Spring command line tool, I'm not sure how much I like the changes in direction of Grails from version to version.  I'm feeling more comfortable just using Spring and Spring Boot, which goes to great lengths to keep backwards compatibility.
